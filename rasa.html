Our server, Khushi, couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.  The drinks were inventive and unique.r server, Khushi, couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.  The drinks were inventive and unique.  One of the cocktails was a special that included peach and cacti juice, a flavour combo we had not tasted elsewhere.  I had the Chennai Chilli, a cocktail consisting of reposado tequila, Barelling Tide Arctic Kiwi Liqueur,  and various interesting fruit juices, that I found to be creative with just enough spice.  My daughter ordered the Jal Jeera, a nonalcoholic beverage consisting of a mix of spices such as carom and mango spice, simple syrup, and club soda. She found it to be refreshing and the aftertaste of spice a welcome surprise.</div>
